# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file does only contain a selection of the most common options. For a
# full list see the documentation:
# http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/config

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = "libvrt"

# The short X.Y version
# version = "1.0.0"
# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
# release = "{}".format(version)


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# If your documentation needs a minimal Sphinx version, state it here.
#
# needs_sphinx = '1.0'

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    "breathe",
]

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ["_templates"]

# The suffix(es) of source filenames.
# You can specify multiple suffix as a list of string:
#
# source_suffix = ['.rst', '.md']
source_suffix = ".rst"

# The master toctree document.
master_doc = "index"

# The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation
# for a list of supported languages.
#
# This is also used if you do content translation via gettext catalogs.
# Usually you set "language" from the command line for these cases.
language = "en"

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# May need to install with 'sudo pip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme' for 'sudo make install'
if not on_rtd:  # only import and set the theme if we're building docs locally
    import sphinx_rtd_theme

    # a list of builtin themes.

    # further.  For a list of options available for each theme, see the
    # documentation.
    #
    # html_theme_options = {}

    # Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
    # relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
    # so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
    # html_static_path = ['_static']

    # Custom sidebar templates, must be a dictionary that maps document names
    # to template names.
    #
    # The default sidebars (for documents that don't match any pattern) are
    # defined by theme itself.  Builtin themes are using these templates by
    # default: ``['localtoc.html', 'relations.html', 'sourcelink.html',
    # 'searchbox.html']``.

# otherwise, readthedocs.org uses their theme by default, so no need to specify it
