* Use read testing framwork for testing vrt_read_packet instead
* Add examples that showcases the low and high level ways of reading
* Documentation doesn't seem to work that well with VRT_WARN_UNUSED macro...
* When using vrt_read_packet, make body point into buffer or memcpy?

* Check that float, double... are inside bounds when writing and validating

# Future
* Restrict keyword?
* Add support for 128 bit float
* Add single header library?
