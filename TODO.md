* Some floating point bounds are wrong, such as gain, position, attitude, and velocity

* Documentation doesn't seem to work that well with VRT_WARN_UNUSED macro. See https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/8114. Use c_id_attributes?
* Copy paste in example/CMakeLists.txt

# Future
* Add support for 128 bit float
* Add single header library?
